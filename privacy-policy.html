      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Browser information (e.g. URL, browser type, ‘click through’ data);
        </li>
        <li>
          Ad reporting or delivery data (e.g. size/type of ad, ad impressions,
          location/format of ad, data about interactions with the ad);
        </li>
        <li>
          Device-type information (e.g. screen dimensions, device brand and

        <li>Information about your activities on our website and Services.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        We may combine information that does not directly identify an individual
        with data collected from other sources and disclose the combined
        information to participating publishers, advertisers and ad networks so
        that they can determine whether to bid on ad inventory and in order to
        improve the relevance of the advertising presented to users. We also use
        the information we collect to host, operate, maintain, secure, and further
        develop and improve our Services, such as to keep track of advertising
        delivery and to measure the effectiveness of advertising delivered through
        our Services, and investigate compliance with
        <span class="website_name">VysaTech</span>’s policies and terms and
        conditions. Some of the third parties that we work with may contribute
        additional data to us directly, which we may combine with our own in order
        to help us provide a better service. We do not collect any information
        that could be used to directly identify an individual.

        The <span class="website_name">VysaTech</span> Ad Exchange uses cookies,

        targeted ads on the device on which you are viewing this policy or a
        different device. These ads are more likely to be relevant to you because
        they are based on inferences drawn from location data, web viewing data
        collected across non-affiliated sites over time, and/or application use
        data collected across non-affiliated apps over time. This is called
